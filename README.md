Rock Paper Scissor Lizard Spock - Project!

Description: I recreated my prototype of the game; Rock Paper Scissor Lizard Spock with html and javascript to make the game functional and I created an endpoint where it would randomly get one of 5 choices! 
The API is hosted via Azure and my JS is fetching the data and determining the winner!

After creating the endpoint and figma, I implemented a PVP mode and integrated a One Round Showdown, Best out of Five and Best out of Seven! I adjusted the build to better match the figma prototype I created earlier! I have two scripts and used session storage to save and check for PvP or CPU mode and check for one round, best out of 5 or best out of seven!

Peer Review: For Endpoint!- Carlos Lopez: Everything works well goodjob!
