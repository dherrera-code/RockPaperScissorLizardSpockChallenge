Rock Paper Scissor Lizard Spock - Prototype and EndPoint

Description: I recreated my prototype of the game; Rock Paper Scissor Lizard Spock with html and javascript to make the game functional and I created an endpoint where it would randomly get one of 5 choices! 
The API is hosted via Azure and my JS is fetching the data and determining the winner!

Peer Review- Carlos Lopez: Everything works well goodjob!
