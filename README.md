Rock Paper Scissor Lizard Spock - Project!

Description: I recreated my prototype of the game; Rock Paper Scissor Lizard Spock with html and javascript to make the game functional and I created an endpoint where it would randomly get one of 5 choices! 
The API is hosted via Azure and my JS is fetching the data and determining the winner!

After creating the endpoint and figma, I implemented a PVP mode and integrated a One Round Showdown, Best out of Five and Best out of Seven! I adjusted the build to better match the figma prototype I created earlier! I have two scripts and used session storage to save and check for PvP or CPU mode and check for one round, best out of 5 or best out of seven!

Peer Review: For Endpoint!- Carlos Lopez: Everything works well goodjob!

Peer Review for the build (Darcy Rose) : works well, I really like that you used buttons. it hides the answers from the other user, which I did not incorporate into my design. I think the design is a bit big for the screen and could be a bit more visually cohesive in terms of color palette. maybe visit the website coolors for inspiration? That said the logic is sound and everything is functional. well done!
